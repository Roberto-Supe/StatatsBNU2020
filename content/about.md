This site was built to provide additional information and content to the lecture slides of the course Environmental Statistics at Beijing Normal University. All the code used for the graphs is included in the posts so it can be used to replicate them with your data. Similarly, It is a page created for you to be familiar with R-Studio and other very important packages that will help you during your studies and career. All the information in the articles followed the lecture slides of Professor Yingxia Li, similar figures and models were translated to R code by Ph.D. candidate Roberto Xavier Supe Tulcan (Supervisor: Professor Ouyang Wei).
