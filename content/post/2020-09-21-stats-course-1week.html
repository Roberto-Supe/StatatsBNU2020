<div id="why-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Why R</h2>
<p>R is one of the most complex and sofisticated statistical softwares. Similarly, the current acceptance of the software is high in many fields and work lines. There is an infinite number of applications with R, you can have linear regressions, spatial analysis, graphs, books, journals, even APPs have been added in the last few years. Scientists are constantly updating the program and other packages for us to find it easier to interact with it.
In these documents, we will provide you with the code required to replicate the main graphs given to you during the course. Additionally, the major parts and elements of the code have some explanations about the role and function so you can understand it better and follow it nicely. At the same time, you will be familiar with a program that is a great skill in the field of environmental science, programming, and statistics in general.</p>

<div id="pareto-chart-with-ggplot2" class="section level2">
<h2>Pareto Chart with ggplot2</h2>
<p>There is no better package for graphs than ggplot2, many of the new functions, packages, and other programs in R aim to set a code compatible with ggplot2. Some packages have updated the old version to one that matches the syntax of ggplot2 like the following example.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#install.packages(c(&quot;ggQC&quot;,&quot;gcookbook&quot;,&quot;tidyverse&quot;)) #the new qcc package for ggplot graphs
library(ggQC)  
library(gcookbook) # for the data set
library(ggplot2)  
data(&quot;uspopchange&quot;) # let&#39;s use the change in population in america as and example
#uspopchange
usa.pop&lt;-uspopchange[1:10,] # there are a lot of states so we can just take the first 10 states for the example data set
ggplot(usa.pop,aes(x=State,y=Change))+
  ggQC::stat_pareto(point.color = &quot;red&quot;, 
                    point.size = 3, 
                    line.color = &quot;black&quot;,
                    bars.fill = c(&quot;steelblue&quot;,&quot;tomato&quot;))+ #fill of the bars is continous therefore you need to set the first and last and you will get a gradient for all the bars 
  theme_bw() #remove the background colour and keep the major and minor axis and some other plot structures </code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-09-21-stats-course-1week_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This clearly looks much better with more control over the elements. There are a few things that we can change to make them better like labels better axis, a legend because a double y axis can mislead the readers. In the following example, we will use all the data set as R is better at working with large data sets.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#install.packages(scales) # use the percent and other notation on the axis
data(&quot;uspopchange&quot;)
usa.pop &lt;- usa.pop[order(usa.pop$Change, decreasing=TRUE),] #order the data set by the values of Change in a decreasing order
usa.pop$State&lt;-factor(usa.pop$State,levels = usa.pop$State) #countries labels in the right place
p=ggplot(usa.pop,aes(x=State,y=Change))+
  ggQC::stat_pareto(point.color = &quot;red&quot;, 
                    point.size = 2.5, 
                    shape=15,
                    line.color = &quot;black&quot;,
                    bars.fill = c(&quot;steelblue&quot;,&quot;tomato&quot;))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,50,100,sum(usa.pop$Change)), # we need to control the left y axis breaks
                     sec.axis = sec_axis(~./sum(usa.pop$Change)*100, #this is Cumulative Sum(y)/sum(all states in change)*100 (%)
                                         breaks = c(0,25,50,75,100), # which breaks do you want to show
                                         labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1), #from the package scales use :: percent, we need to use percent_format(scale=1) because transform the axis in 100 already 
                                         name = &quot;Country Cumulative Change&quot;))+ # give it a name
  geom_text(aes(label=Change),nudge_y = -2.5,colour=&quot;white&quot;,size=3)+ 
  labs(title=&quot;Pareto Chart&quot;,y=&quot;Population Change (million people)&quot;)+
  theme_bw(base_size = 13,base_family = &quot;serif&quot;) #sans= Arial, mono= Courier, serif= Times New Roman

<pre class="r"><code># This is nearly perfect yet the legend is not showing in our figure so we can add it ourselfs
# first, we will need need to have a data set that can be used to add a legend to the figure

<p>Here we clearly have full control of the elements of the plot. It may look like a lot of work now but once you get familiar with the sentence functions and elements it will be easier and of course, that will be very useful because many plots will use the same coding structure in the R universe. Now, despite it takes more than a few clicks to get our Pareto Chart in you added more knowledge like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Order data sets by different variables.</li>
<li>Add a second y-axis.</li>
<li>Change the labels, breaks of the axis (for x axis just replace y with x).</li>
<li>Give better axis labels.</li>
<li>Add text inside figures and for each level of the category.</li>
<li>Change the theme of plots.</li>
<li>Change the text font family, colour, and size.</li>
<li>Add points text rectagles to build special legends.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="histograms" class="section level2">
<h2>Histograms</h2>
<p>Histograms help you to visualize the approximate distribution of your data. It is similar to the bar plot but we can change the number of <code>bins</code> that we want to display, depending on the number of observations we may need more or less. The default number of bins is 30, here, will do the job for large data sets, while small data sets can use a smaller <code>bins</code> to avoid gaphs. We will use <code>geom_histogram</code> and other parameters depending on your needs.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(diamonds,aes(x=price))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 45,fill=&quot;steelblue&quot;,colour=&quot;black&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-09-21-stats-course-1week_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We have other options like <code>binwidth</code> which defines the width of each bin to the selected value in units of x. In the example above we said to draw 45 bins and now we want as many bins as long each is 2 x units.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#install.packages(UsingR) # get the data set
library(UsingR)
ggplot(father.son, aes(x = fheight*2.54)) +      # units transforamtion                     
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..),fill=&quot;grey80&quot;,binwidth = 2) +  #bins each 2cm height
  geom_density()+ #density distribution on top of the histograms
  theme_light()</code></pre>

</div>
<div id="box-plots" class="section level2">
<h2>Box plots</h2>
<p>They are great ways to represent the distribution of the data. Boxplots are extremely good at that as we can easily see the median, interquartile range (IQR), minimum, maximum values as well as any outlier presented in the data.</p>
<p>We will plot the height of the characters from Star Wars saga grouped by their genders</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)
#install.packages(&quot;ggsci&quot;)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggsci) #many colour palette
ggplot(starwars, aes(x = gender, y = height)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=gender))+ # fill each boxplot by gender 
  scale_fill_aaas(alpha = 0.8) # add some transparency to the fill colour 0.2</code></pre>

</div>
<div id="qq-plot" class="section level2">
<h2>QQ plot</h2>
<p>Lastly, one very important scatter plot uses the function <code>geom_qq</code> which creates QQ plots to check the normality of the data, it compares the empirical distribution to a theoretical one. Use <code>geom_qq()</code> and <code>geom_qq_line()</code> and the <code>**sample= variable**</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#install.packages(gcookbook)
#install.packages(gapminder)
library(gcookbook)
library(gapminder)
#normally distributed
ggplot(heightweight, aes(sample = heightIn)) +
  geom_qq() + #points 
  geom_qq_line() #line

#not normally distributed 
ggplot(gapminder, aes(sample = lifeExp)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line()+
  facet_wrap(.~continent,nrow = 2)+
  theme_test()</code></pre>

</div>
<p>with <code>facet_*</code> we can separate the data and have different groups and many different graphs.</p>

<div id="cumulative-distribution-function-cdf" class="section level2">
<h2>Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)</h2>
<p>The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a real-valued random variable X, or just distribution function of X, evaluated at x, is the probability that X will take a value less than or equal to x.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(uspopchange,aes(x=Change))+

<h2>Correlation plot &amp; Corelogram</h2>
<p>Correlations are something we will need the majority of the time. They will help you to visualize the relationship between your variables.

<ul>
<li>Correlations are obtained by using <code>psych::corr.test()</code>. Here you will have a correlation and the p-value of each correlation</li>
<li>There are a few options for the correlation plots: <code>ggcorrplot</code> or <code>ggcorrplot.mixed</code>.</li>
<li>Here, we added <code>p.mat= p.values.correlation</code> which has the correlation p-values to do different options. In the first we set significant levels to draw asterics in the correlations. In the second graph, we set set the significant level of 0.05 any value bigger than that it will be marked with an x <code>pch</code>. We can also remove the nonsignificant correlations by setting <code>insig="blank"</code></li>
</ul>
