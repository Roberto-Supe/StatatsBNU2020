      <description>library(PerformanceAnalytics)library(tidyverse)library(psych)Multiple Linear RegressionThis week we will cover multiple linear regression. As in previous post and in any model that you want to do we will need to test our assumtions and follow some general steps
Procedure to perform Multiple Linear Regression:
Scatterplot matrixFit multiple linear regression modelsCalculation estimate parameters, determine their standard errors, obtain tests and confidence intervals.Evaluation and explanationLet’s have our data</description>

      <description>This week we will cover data summaries, data structure, linear regression and its assumptions.
At the beginning of each session we will need to load our libraries, so let’s load the packages for this week
library(tidyverse)library(plotrix)library(ggpubr) #install.packages(&amp;quot;ggpubr&amp;quot;)library(qqplotr) #install.packages(&amp;quot;qqplotr&amp;quot;)library(PerformanceAnalytics)#install.packages(&amp;quot;PerformanceAnalytics&amp;quot;)library(gcookbook)library(tidyr) #install.packages(&amp;quot;tidyr&amp;quot;) Sample Statistics and Summary resultsMean, variance, and error values are always required for the final report. It can take a while to sort the data in the right way and several times you may want to check how your data looks frequently.</description>

      <description>Why RR is one of the most complex and sofisticated statistical softwares. Similarly, the current acceptance of the software is high in many fields and work lines. There is an infinite number of applications with R, you can have linear regressions, spatial analysis, graphs, books, journals, even APPs have been added in the last few years. Scientists are constantly updating the program and other packages for us to find it easier to interact with it.</description>
